<h1>WompChat Chrome Extension</h1>

<p>
    This is a little venture I went on for my chat â™¥    
</p>

<p>
    After playing around with live streaming on other popular platforms such as YouTube. I found the lack of features frustrating. Twitch got one thing right: it built a quality live-chat and created opportunities for community building.
    To build on this; other great devs built out browser extensions to further add to the quality of life features, bringing with it Emoticons and even more community building. 
</p>

<p>
    Though I do love these platforms, none of them have yet built out features for youtube.
</p>

<h3>
    I decided I didn't want to wait and built out something of my own. Find is on the Chrome Store Below.
