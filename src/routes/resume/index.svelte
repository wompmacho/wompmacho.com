	<p>
		These are just a few areas where I have spent considerable time learning and developing skills that are driven by my passion for technology. I love creating, fixing, tweaking, playing with new things, new ideas, new & old concepts…

		When I was in highschool I was building computers and recording studios. When I was in College I was building Web Sites and Data Centers. Now I am building myself as an Influencer and Entertainer.
