<h4 class="">Sep 2017 - Present</h4>
<p>
	As a T3 Overwatch Coach I have had the unique opportunity to engage with people
	of all ages and backgrounds looking to improve, master their abilities and join the path to becoming
	professionals in esports. I have worked closely with multiple teams and individuals and assisted
	them in their growth in esports, strategy, planning and mindset for becoming a professional gamer. I
	am currently coaching 4 teams actively ranging from diamond tier to T3 top 500 teams. As a streamer
	and youtuber I have also had the unique opportunity to be exposed to the social media presence of
	the
	Overwatch scene and participated in many events which have helped organizations within the Overwatch
	realm
	grow. This has also been a great platform for me to live coach students and teams so that I can
	reach a broader audience while also 1on1 coaching individuals. I do a lot of vod reviews and
	educational content for teams privately with 1000+ hours of coaching ranging in skill from bronze
	to Top 500. I strive to accomplish the goal of having every student to receive my coaching to become
	a better player and professional in some meaningful and impactful way.
