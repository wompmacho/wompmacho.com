<h1>About</h1>

<h2>(•_•)</h2>

<p>
	I am just some guy with a voice who is always thinking about the future. I
	have been interested in tech my entire life... It started out as a distant admiration for sci-fi shows,
	video games, learning of amazing people and amazing things. I was obsessed with space… the final frontier.
	New technology and the tech giants who are creating the future were my everyday bread and butter. This love
	for tech had the chance to flourish when I found my way into art and music. My artistry enveloped my
	highschool years. Through my guitar and music I found myself creating a recording studio at home. One thing
	led to another and I found myself deeply enthralled with audio engineering and building computers to handle
	the processing. I began tweaking little things, anything I can get my hands on... Eventually I found my way
	into computer science and IT. I found a new career in fixing and creating... These skills bled into all
	parts
	of my life. Esports peaked my interest and again I found my way into the tech side and developing platforms.
	Building machines that pushed as many frames as possible to get that bleeding edge. I began playing with
	virtual machines, arduino, raspberry pi and bare-metal machines. I started hosting websites and game servers
	from home. Eventually I started streaming and found a new joy in the Twitch community. I developed my
	streaming portfolio and platform. Graphic design, content creation, lighting, filmography, social media,
	websites, custom scripting overlays, entertainment, and lets not forget GAMING.
